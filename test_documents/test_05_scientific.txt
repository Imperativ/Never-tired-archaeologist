CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Technology

Abstract:
CRISPR-Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing tool that allows precise modification of DNA sequences in living organisms.

Mechanism:
The Cas9 protein acts as molecular scissors, guided by RNA to specific DNA locations. Upon binding, Cas9 creates double-strand breaks, triggering cellular repair mechanisms that can be exploited to insert, delete, or modify genes.

Applications:
- Disease treatment (sickle cell anemia, cancer immunotherapy)
- Agricultural improvements (drought-resistant crops)
- Biotechnology (engineered microorganisms)

Ethical considerations include germline editing and potential off-target effects.
